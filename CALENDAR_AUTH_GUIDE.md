# Google Calendar Authorization Guide

## ðŸ“… New Feature: Email-Based Calendar Connection

I've created a new page where users can connect their Google Calendar by just entering their email address.

### **Link to Share:**
```
https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/connect-calendar.html
```

### **How It Works:**

1. **User visits the link** â†’ Sees a form asking for their email
2. **User enters email** â†’ e.g., `user@example.com`
3. **User clicks "Connect Google Calendar"** â†’ Backend creates/finds user account
4. **Redirects to Google** â†’ User sees Google OAuth consent screen
5. **User authorizes** â†’ Grants calendar access
6. **Success!** â†’ User calendar is now connected

### **What Happens After Authorization:**

- User's access tokens are stored in database (`gmail_sender` table)
- You can now add calendar events directly to their Google Calendar
- Events will automatically appear in their calendar with reminders

## ðŸ”— **Two Ways to Connect:**

### **Method 1: Email-Based (NEW)** âœ…
**Link:** `https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/connect-calendar.html`

- User enters their email
- If user doesn't exist, account is auto-created
- Then redirects to Google OAuth

**You can also pre-fill email:**
```
https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/connect-calendar.html?email=user@example.com
```

### **Method 2: User ID-Based (Existing)**
**Link:** `https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/calendar-auth.html?userId=<USER_ID>`

- Requires you to know the user's ID from database
- Used when user already exists in system

---

## ðŸ“§ **Adding Events to User Calendars**

Once a user has authorized, you can add events using the API:

### **API Endpoint:**
```
POST https://mandli-production.up.railway.app/api/calendar/send-invite
```

### **Request:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user-id-from-database",
  "title": "Mandli Duty - Morning Shift",
  "description": "Your duty assignment for today",
  "startDateTime": "2025-11-01T06:00:00",
  "endDateTime": "2025-11-01T12:00:00",
  "timeZone": "America/New_York"
}
```

### **Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Calendar event created for John Smith",
  "event": {
    "id": "event-id-from-google",
    "title": "Mandli Duty - Morning Shift",
    "start": "2025-11-01T06:00:00-04:00",
    "end": "2025-11-01T12:00:00-04:00",
    "htmlLink": "https://calendar.google.com/event?eid=..."
  }
}
```

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Flow**

### **Step 1: Deploy the New Page**
The file `connect-calendar.html` has been created. To deploy it:

```bash
# Add the new file
git add connect-calendar.html

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add email-based calendar connection page"

# Push to GitHub (Vercel will auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Test the Connection Flow**

1. Open: https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/connect-calendar.html
2. Enter your email (e.g., `ai@ferociter.co`)
3. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
4. You'll be redirected to Google
5. Sign in and authorize
6. You'll see "Calendar Connected!" success page

### **Step 3: Verify Authorization**

Check if user is connected:
```bash
curl https://mandli-production.up.railway.app/api/calendar/status/<USER_ID> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>"
```

---

## ðŸ”„ **Complete Workflow**

### **Onboarding New Users:**

1. **Send them the calendar connection link:**
   ```
   https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/connect-calendar.html?email=user@example.com
   ```

2. **They authorize their calendar** (one-time setup)

3. **You assign them duties** (via admin panel)

4. **System automatically adds events to their calendar** (via API)

### **Monthly Schedule Distribution:**

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for your workflow
async function distributeMonthlySchedule(month) {
  // 1. Get all assignments for the month
  const assignments = await getAssignments(month);

  // 2. For each assignment
  for (const assignment of assignments) {
    // 3. Check if user has authorized calendar
    const isConnected = await checkCalendarStatus(assignment.userId);

    if (isConnected) {
      // 4. Add event to their calendar
      await sendCalendarInvite({
        userId: assignment.userId,
        title: `Mandli Duty - ${assignment.shift}`,
        startDateTime: `${assignment.date}T${assignment.startTime}`,
        endDateTime: `${assignment.date}T${assignment.endTime}`
      });
    } else {
      // 5. Send email reminder to connect calendar
      await sendEmailReminder(assignment.userEmail);
    }
  }
}
```
