# Remaining Tasks for Mandli Scheduling System

## üìå Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. ‚úÖ Database cleaned and 3 test users added
2. ‚úÖ Full end-to-end availability submission tested (all 3 users submitted)
3. ‚úÖ Admin panel can view all submissions with user names
4. ‚úÖ User management interface created
5. ‚úÖ Admin login verified
6. ‚úÖ Fixed critical API bug (created_at ‚Üí submitted_at)
7. ‚úÖ Fixed RLS policy violations
8. ‚úÖ CORS configuration variables set on Railway
9. ‚úÖ Empty commit pushed to trigger Railway redeployment

### ‚è≥ Waiting for Railway
Railway is redeploying after the push. The deployment may take 2-5 minutes.

**To check Railway deployment status:**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your `mandli-production` project
3. Click on the backend service
4. Look at the **Deployments** tab to see if the latest deployment is complete

Once Railway shows "Active" or "Success", wait 1-2 minutes and then test again with:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/test-vercel-deployment.js
```

## üîÑ Next Steps After Railway Deploys

### 1. Verify Vercel Login Works
Once CORS is fixed, test login at: https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app

**What to test:**
- [ ] Can login with admin credentials (mandli/Mandli8)
- [ ] Dashboard loads properly
- [ ] Can view all users
- [ ] Can see availability data

### 2. Test User Availability Links
Test the unique links for each user:

**John Smith:**
```
https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/availability.html?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMTMyM2RjZS1mYTIxLTQ4NGEtYWQ3Mi1lMmM5NzhlZWE2MTMiLCJuYW1lIjoiSm9obiBTbWl0aCIsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYxODQ2OTMxLCJleHAiOjE3Njk2MjI5MzF9.e4obKHEl7WG9dtY_0cJHOil3ttRdFAqXfbzm7kuaPS0
```

**What to test:**
- [ ] Page loads and shows "Hi John Smith"
- [ ] Can select availability for the month
- [ ] Can submit availability
- [ ] Submission shows success message

### 3. Test Calendar OAuth Flow (linkcal.html)

**URL to test:**
```
https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/linkcal.html
```

**What to test:**
- [ ] "Link Google Calendar" button appears
- [ ] Clicking button opens Google OAuth popup
- [ ] After authorizing, shows success message
- [ ] Can sync calendar events

**Note:** This requires the Google OAuth credentials to be properly configured on Railway:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` (should point to Vercel)

### 4. Verify Matching Algorithm Runs

The matching algorithm should run automatically when:
1. Users submit availability
2. Admin manually triggers schedule generation

**To test:**
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Check if there's a "Generate Schedule" or similar button
3. Click it to trigger the matching algorithm
4. Verify that a schedule is created based on the availability data

**Check if algorithm is triggered on availability submission:**
- Look in Railway logs for "matching" or "schedule generation" messages
- Check if schedules table has new entries after availability is submitted

## üêõ Potential Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: Railway Still Shows Old CORS
**Symptom:** Test still shows `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000`

**Solutions:**
1. Wait longer (Railway might still be deploying)
2. Check Railway dashboard for deployment errors
3. Manually restart the service from Railway dashboard
4. Check that environment variables are set in the correct service

### Issue 2: Google OAuth Not Working
**Symptom:** "Redirect URI mismatch" error or OAuth fails

**Solution:**
- Update `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` on Railway to match Vercel URL
- Make sure it's set to: `https://mandli-scheduling.vercel.app/calendar/callback`
- Update the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console OAuth settings

### Issue 3: Token Expiration
**Symptom:** User links don't work

**Solution:**
The test user tokens expire on July 1, 2026 (90 days from creation). If testing after that date, regenerate tokens with:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/quick-add-users.js
```

## üìù Test Scripts Available

Run these from the `backend` directory:

```bash
# Test Vercel deployment and CORS
node scripts/test-vercel-deployment.js

# Verify admin can see availability
node scripts/check-admin-view.js

# Check database directly
node scripts/check-database-availability.js

# Test admin login specifically
node scripts/test-admin-login.js

# Debug API responses
node scripts/debug-admin-api.js
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

The system is fully production-ready when:

- [ ] Vercel login works
- [ ] All API calls from Vercel to Railway succeed
- [ ] User availability links work from Vercel
- [ ] Admin can view all submissions
- [ ] Google Calendar OAuth works
- [ ] Matching algorithm generates schedules
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

## üìû If You Need More Help

If Railway deployment doesn't pick up the changes:
1. Try manually restarting from Railway dashboard
2. Check Railway logs for any errors
3. Verify environment variables are visible in Railway settings
4. Try the Railway CLI restart command from `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
